# HackThis control-box
CSV Spreadsheet Creator for raw data from Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico

Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden developed Growing Beyond Earth (GBE) to get students involved with NASAâ€™s research on plants. As the program got started in 2015, Fairchild began distributing a kit of off-the-shelf parts for teachers and students to assemble into plant habitats like those aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Over the years, the components evolded from off-the-shelf parts into the GBE Control Box, which was created to provide more consistent environmental control while giving students greater access to the underlying technology.

The Raspberry Pi Pico, which is the heart of the GBE Control Box, provides certain raw data to the Raspberry Pi Zero, such as the date, time, fan speed, light brightness, and more. This CSV Spreadsheet Creator program is designed to take that data, organize it, and make it presentable through the use of a spreadsheet.
