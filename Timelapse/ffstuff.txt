The final parameter is the filename of the output video. Here’s what the other parameters mean:
framerate: the number of images to render per second in the video

pattern_type: we set this to glob to tell ffmpeg to use all the images that match the pattern in the following parameter.

i: a pattern that matches all the input photos in your timelapse. Note that this, as with most other things on a UNIX command line, is case sensitive.

s:v: The size of the output video. Ensure that the aspect ratio matches your photos to avoid skewing the images (we’ll talk about cropping later).

c:v: The output video codec (here, H264). 

crf: A parameter specific to the H264 codec that determines the quality/compression. More on this later.

pix_fmt: this needs to be set to yuv420p to allow many players, such as Quicktime to play the video
